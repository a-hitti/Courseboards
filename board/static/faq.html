Be reasonable.  Please don't harass people.  Beyond that, have fun.  Go wild!

What is this site for?
See our about page!  Spoiler alert: to make class more awesome.
<br>
Why should I use your site?
It's a fun, low-stress way to interact with your class and your classmates.
<br>
Why anonymous?
No one will ever judge you for any question you ask, so you can clarify as much as you want.
<br>
Why don't you have [INSERT AWESOME FEATURE HERE]?
Probably we just didn't think of it.  If you have ideas for cool things we should be doing with CourseBoards, contact us!<p></center><br><br>
