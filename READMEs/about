CourseBoards is by students, for students.

What:
A message board for interacting with the other students in your class.  Got a question about what the professor is saying?  Go ahead, start a thread.  Feeling bored?  Revive an old thread.  Curious if anyone else thinks your professor is cute?  Yeah, that needs its own thread.  Definitely.

Why:
Sometimes people get bored in class, and instead of staying involved in class, they open their computers and go on facebook, or reddit, and miss all of the material in the class.  What if you could stay engaged in the class, but also keep yourself entertained?  That's the space that this website aims to fill.

How:
Classes are restricted to only when the class is actually running, so you won't be deluged by meaningless things that people randomly post, but you'll only be affected by relevant posts from other students in your class.  It's pretty cool, if we say so ourselves.  Also, posts persist from class to class, so you can start up a discussion again that you had last class.
